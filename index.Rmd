title: "Clinical manifestations of primary CoQ deficiencies"

Primary coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiencies are clinically heterogeneous and lack a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. With this platform, we aim to gain insight of the most common manifestations associated with the different COQ genes to improve the diagnosis of patients.

Here you can search the frequency of clinical manifestations grouped by system for each gene.

Go to table to search the data by involved system, specific manifestation or COQ gene.
