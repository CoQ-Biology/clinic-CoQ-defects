title: "Clinical manifestations of primary CoQ deficiencies"

---

<br>

Primary coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiencies are clinically heterogeneous and currently lack a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. With this platform, we aim to compile the frequency of manifestations associated with the different *COQ* genes that are reported in the literature, to improve the diagnosis of patients.

In the tabs above you can search the frequency of clinical manifestations grouped by system for each gene.

Go to table to search the data by involved system, specific manifestation or *COQ* gene.

This tool is part of the review *GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS IN PRIMARY COENZYME Q DEFICIENCIES*, María Alcázar-Fabra, Francisco Rodríguez-Sánchez, Eva Trevisson & Gloria Brea-Calvo (submitted).
